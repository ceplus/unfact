* basic
+ truncase filename on the log
- port to linux
- log supression
- smoke test for data race 
  - simple thread abstraction
- thread local for null platform
- hashtable for emulating tls
- introduce rb-tree color-bit
- backoff on spinlock
- make set_tree copiable
- ordered single linked list for tree_set replacement
- heavy lock

* heap profiler
- rename and move accumulation_formatter_t -> aggregative_tracing_formatter(?)
  - accumulation_formatter_t is bad name. we should capture its property using good name...
  - generalize and remove final() dependency.
- prune empty tree nodes
- formatting utility (extras)
- pretty formatting with ","
- support alerting
- support dynamic enabling/disabling per thread


* clock profiler
> clock_t for each platform
  + windows
  - linux
+ non-scoepd time
  + separate pure scope from counting scope
- clear subtree
- skip empty node on formatting
- generalize flat_tracing_formatter_t
- app integraton trial
- support alerting
- does tests using tick counts

* misc
- align var name 'other' -> 'that'
- try read-write lock and compare the performance
- disable/enable profiler
  - depth-based control
- put license term

------

DONE:
* basic
+ make default page size customizable
. make iterator lockable (concurrent_iterator)

* heap profiler
+ add invariant checker for rb-tree
+ tree_set::node
+ extract node as as intrusive pseudo-container
+ tree_set
. tree_map
+ arena_t::swap()
. hash_set
+ set_tree
+ static_string_t
+ call tracer (call tree)
+ heap_tracer
  + accumulated consumption of subtree
+ heap_tracing_formatter_t
+ rename subtree_begin -> begin_at
> make MT ready
  + lock_treat
  + arena
  + tree_set
  + set_tree
  + tree_trader
  + accumulation_count
  . accumulation_formatter
  + heap_tracer
+ make to_iterator() and to_ticket() static
. non intrusive lock_scope ?
  . goal: for iterator
+ provide lock_scope_type for all lockable object
  (add to Lockable concept requirements)
+ eliminate Area type parameter
  + tree_set_skeleton
  + tree_set
  + set_tree
  + tree_tracer
+ make arena to enforce alignment restriction
. make tree_tracer::push() accept char*, not only static_string
. synchronizable_t for lock with least sig bit
  . use as tree_set_skeleton::m_root
  -> too tricky. and node count of set_tree wouldn't go so large.
     rbtree node count is more serious conern: it is allocated per 
     heap block.
+ thread specific data
+ extra macros
. introduce 'detail' namespace
+ cleanup/organize config definitions
  to ensure customizability:
  + backdoor_allocator
  + log
+ enhance arena debug facility
  + clear 0xdeadbeaf

* clock profiler
+ sticky
+ reset (zero-clear)
